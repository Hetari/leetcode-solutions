This repository contains my personal solutions to algorithmic challenges on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). My goal is to master data structures and algorithms through consistent practice.

## 📁 Organization

- **Categories**: Solutions are grouped by problem type (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming).
- **Format**: Each solution includes a detailed explanation and time/space complexity analysis.
- **Language**: Primary focus on efficient implementations.

## 📚 Problem Categories

| Category | Topics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Arrays & Hashing** | Sorting, Sets, Maps |
| **Two Pointers** | Fast & Slow pointers, Sliding Window |
| **Trees & Graphs** | DFS/BFS, Recursion, Shortest Path |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Memoization, Tabulation |

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Master common interview patterns (Grokking the Coding Interview).
- Achieve optimal performance for every problem.
- Consistently improve problem-solving speed and accuracy.

## 🛠️ Usage

To view a solution, navigate to the respective category folder or search by problem name.
